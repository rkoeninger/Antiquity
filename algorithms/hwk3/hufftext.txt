Write a program that computes a Huffman tree and associated Huffman code for a given text, where the set of symbols are the ASCII codes which appear in text and the frequency of a symbol is its frequency in the text.  Use the text for Homework 3 as given here as the input to your program.  The output of your program should display the ASCII code, the corresponding Huffman code and the compression factor when using the Huffman codes instead of the ASCII codes.
